# Battery Assault
See how long you can survive before your ship’s battery runs dry!

Your battery powers your weapons, shield and thrusters. Use your laser and rocket to defeat enemies and pick up their batteries to keep yourself charged.

Any attack that hits your ship will destroy it. Point your shield at an enemy to block their attack - your shield uses battery power to block damage.

Controls:
  - `1` to aim your laser.
  - `2` to aim your rocket.
  - `W` to choose somewhere to move to.
  - `Q` to rotate your shield.

All art and audio was made from scratch during the jam.

This is the first time we’ve competed in a game jam and the first time either of us have made a game using a game engine. We made a lot of mistakes but also learned many things along the way. We’ll definitely be coming back for more jams in the future.
